# Quality-Assessment-of-Aerial-LiDAR-Data
This project involved a comprehensive quality assessment of aerial LiDAR data collected for the IIT Kanpur campus. The study focused on evaluating various aspects such as vertical and horizontal accuracy, data density, Nominal Pulse Spacing (NPS), and spatial distribution. By utilizing tools like MATLAB, CloudCompare, and QGIS, the project assessed the reliability and suitability of the LiDAR dataset for applications in terrain modeling, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. The results indicated that the LiDAR data met the required accuracy standards, making it a valuable resource for geospatial analysis and decision-making.
